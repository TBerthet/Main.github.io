## INSA Lyon (National Institute of Applied Sciences) 

![insa_logo](/pictures/insa_logo.png){: width="240px"}

Lyon, France  
*September 2022 – August 2025*  
**Engineering degree in Bioinformatics and Modeling (MSc Equivalent)**  
**GPA:** 3.9 / 4.0

**Main Topics:**  
  - Data Analysis
  - Omics
  - Sequencing
  - Statistics
  - Computer Science
  - AI
  - Biomathematics
  - Chemistry
  - Physiology
  - Cellular Biology
  - ...

**Projects:**  
- **Gene Mapper algorithm** : Group project for Omics 2 course. The goal was to implement an algorithm using **Python** and **Jupyter**, allowing to map reads to a reference genome. The main difficulties were to deal with time issues to make quick enough mapper.
  
- **Speed Dating Data Analysis** : Duo project for an AI courses. The goal was to use and compare various **supervised machine learning technics** in order to predict the possibility of a second date.
  
- **Portrait Identification Software** : Group Project for Software Development course. The goal was to simulate a real Software Development experience. The client askus to realize an software launchable on his computer allowing to generate faces and to get closer to the face of a suspect. This project was coded in **Python**, required the use of **GitHub** and the implementation of a **Variationnal Convolutionnal Autoencoder** and **Genetic Algorithm**.
  
- **Modelisation of Rumor Propagation** : Group Project for a Biomathematics course. Modelisation of a rumor propagation in 2D, then 3D and on a scale of a city using **Matlab** for simulation and **diffusion-reaction equation for our model.** 
  


**About the Program:**  
A multidisciplinary engineering curriculum blending biology, mathematics, and computer science for biomedical applications.

### Yonsei International Summer School

*June 2023 – August 2023*  
**GPA:** 4.30 

**Courses Taken:**  
- AI & Design  
- Korean Language Beginner (Level 1)

**Project :**
**MRI and CNN : classification on tumor types** : Classifier created for the AI & Design course. At first I used an already existing model (Resnet) to identify tumor types on MRI. I decided also to realise an alternative project by coding my own **Convolutional Neural Network** to do so.

**Reflections:**
